	<div id="login">The registration and login aspects of the application will require consideration to a number of 
	different areas to restrict access to unauthorised users while protecting users and their data. First of all 
	will be guidance and restrictions to ensure any usernames chosen are suitable, unique and inoffensive. 
	Passwords will need to adhere to rules regarding length, mixing the use of letters, numbers and special 
	characters and the avoidance of commonly used passwords. An element of appropriate encryption will be 
	advisable to protect the passwords and user data. <br><br>A student studying computing or computing 
	with information security will have sufficient knowledge and skills to fulfil these requirements thereby 
	ensuring a safe experience for the user. Again as  previously mentioned close co-operation with other team
	members would be strongly advised.
