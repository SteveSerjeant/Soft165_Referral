	<div id="security">As mentioned on the index page their should be an exchange of ideas and co-operation with
	the different areas of the proposed web application. In this instance there is a case to suggest the all elements 
	of the application require security to some degree. The details will be expanded on within each sub-section of 
	this guide.
	
	The security aspects of the application overlap and expand on the points covered 
	in the registration and login section on the following page. The password rules regarding length and 
	the use of numbers and special characters are tools that are useful to prevent 'dictionary attacks'. 
	These are methods of trying to gain access to systems using a file of commonly used passwords phrases 
	including letters replaced with numbers or characters, like zero for the letter 'o', or the '@' sign for 
	the letter 'e'. <br><br>The actual physical connections used for connection and chat options will also 
	require protection using encryption and secure computer and network protocols to prevent unauthorised access.
	Naturally a student on a security course would be the best informed for this side of the project but every 
	member of the team would benefit from exposure to all sections of the final project.<br>
