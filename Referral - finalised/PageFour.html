	<div id="game">The idea of the game is to provide a short distraction as and when required by the user. 
	The range of potential subjects is quite large covering a variety of genres. It could be a simple crossword, 
	hangman, or even something like battleships. It doesn’t even have to be a game, other considerations could 
	be simple colour by number puzzles or brain-teasers. The choice is endless. <br><br>Naturally the most 
	obvious student for this aspect of the application would be studying some form of computing with gaming but 
	this does exclude co-operation from others. As has been shown throughout this would not be the topic for 
	a single person,a consensus would be needed from the group as to the type and complexity of game required.
