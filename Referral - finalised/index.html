	<div id="d2">The purpose of this site is to introduce a strategy for collaborative working to produce a web application. 
		It cannot be emphasised enough that the key to a successful team effort is for the team to have open honest
		discussions about their own strengths and weaknesses. This has to happen without ego or a "my way or the highway"
		approach from any team member(s). This would be a sure way to a poor sunstandard final product that would be unfit
		for purpose.<br><br>
		In this case the desired result is a "to-do" application, althouth the approach could be adapted and modified for
		a range of similar products. We also discuss a breakdown of the required features of the 
		app and the most suitable areas of study covering the skills needed, although an element of cross specialty should
		be encouraged for maximum team efficiency<br><br>A list of potential features for the app are
		listed below and there are links on the left to pages that cover the points in more detail.<br><br>
